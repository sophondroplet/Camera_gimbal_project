CAD files and drawings
======================

This folder contains STEP (3D CAD) files and drawings for the camera gimbal assembly.

Contents
- `3d_model/` — STEP files for each major part (connectors, top motor jig, TPU vibration damp rubber, and the full assembly). These can be opened in CAD tools such as FreeCAD, Fusion360 or SolidWorks.
- `drawings/Camera_gimbal_drawing.pdf` — a printable drawing with dimensions and assembly notes.

Usage
- Open STEP files in your preferred CAD package. For FreeCAD, use File → Open and select `.step` files. For Fusion360, import the STEP.
- Use `Camera_gimbal_drawing.pdf` for measurements, mounting hole locations and BOM references.

Notes
- STEP files may contain multiple solids and named parts. Export single-part STLs if you need to 3D print components.
